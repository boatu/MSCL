    <p class="heading">About us</p>
    <p class="text">Club Members will practice every meeting to engage in competitions. Through practice, they will get more skilled at time management in real competitions, so that they will have more success. Club members will practice either the speed/mini competitions, or they will work on the large project in the meetings. We aim to create a fostering passion for STEM and coding among our young minds.</p>
